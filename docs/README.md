Our containerization strategy leverages Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for secure and efficient image management. The application architecture is divided into two primary components, each maintained in dedicated repositories:
- A frontend repository housing the user interface components
- A backend repository containing the core application logic and API services

Both repositories are configured with AES-256 encryption, ensuring the security of our container images. The repositories support mutable tags, facilitating our continuous deployment pipeline and enabling rapid iterations of our application components.

### Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

![EKS](Images/EKS.png)
The production environment operates on a dedicated EKS cluster named `patient-insight-eks-cluster`. This cluster represents our commitment to container orchestration excellence, running on Kubernetes version 1.31. The cluster architecture is designed with both performance and cost-efficiency in mind, implementing a sophisticated node group configuration that balances resource availability with operational costs.

![Node Group](Images/NodeGroup.png)

Our node group configuration exemplifies this balance:

### Overview
Our project implements an automated data processing pipeline using AWS Lambda, designed to streamline the handling of new medical datasets. This serverless solution automatically triggers our data processing workflows whenever new data is uploaded to our S3 storage bucket, ensuring continuous updates to our medical analysis system.

### Lambda Function Implementation
The core of our automation is a Lambda function that monitors our S3 bucket for new dataset uploads. When new medical data arrives, the function automatically initiates our Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which orchestrates the entire data processing pipeline. This event-driven approach eliminates the need for manual intervention in our data processing workflow, ensuring immediate handling of new information.

### Data Processing Workflow

![DAG Run](Images/DAG.png)

Upon triggering, the Lambda function initiates a series of data processing steps through our Airflow pipeline. The workflow begins with comprehensive data preprocessing, where the raw medical data is cleaned, standardized, and validated. Following this, the pipeline generates statistical analyses and reports, providing insights into the new dataset's characteristics and quality metrics.

### Vector Database Integration

![Vector Database](Images/Pinecone.png)
The final stage of our automated pipeline involves generating embeddings for the processed medical data. These embeddings are crucial for our medical analysis system, as they enable efficient similarity searches and case comparisons. The Lambda function ensures that all new data is properly vectorized and stored in our Pinecone vector database, maintaining the system's ability to provide accurate medical insights.

This infrastructure supports our medical analysis pipeline, where users can interact with generated doctor reports through a sophisticated question-answering system.

### Model Deployment Strategy
![Endpoint](Images/Endpoints.png)

We deploy OpenBioLLM, a Llama-based model fine-tuned on biomedical data(This is a pretrained model from hugging face and we are not finetuning it), through SageMaker's managed endpoints. The deployment process involves packaging the pre-trained model, configuring the endpoint for optimal performance, and establishing auto-scaling policies to handle varying loads. Our endpoint configuration utilizes ml.g4dn.xlarge instances with auto-scaling capabilities, ensuring cost-effective yet responsive model serving.

### Model Versioning and Tracking
![MLFlow](Images/MLFlow.png)

The system integrates with SageMaker's managed MLflow service for comprehensive experiment tracking and model versioning. Each model configuration and deployment is tracked through MLflow, with artifacts stored in S3 buckets. This integration enables version control of model configurations, monitoring of deployment performance, and systematic tracking of model interactions. The MLflow dashboard provides insights into model performance metrics, making it easier to maintain and optimize our deployment over time.

### Integration Architecture
The deployment integrates seamlessly with our larger pipeline, where doctor reports generated from our RAG system are stored and versioned in MLflow. Users can query these reports through the deployed OpenBioLLM endpoint, receiving medically-contextualized responses. This architecture ensures reliable model serving while maintaining comprehensive tracking of all model interactions and configurations.


## Deployemnt Automation through Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

## Model and Data Drift Monitoring

**Since we will be using a pretrained model, we will not be able to retrain the model if there is a model decay. We will be using the pretrained model to generate doctor reports and we will be monitoring the data drift and retrieval performance.**

So by retrival performance, we mean the performance of the RAG system. We set a threshold of 0.5 for the retrieval score. If the retrieval score is below 0.5, we will be sending an alert to the team. We also have a lambda fucntion that generates the embeddings and stores it in the vector database whenever the new data is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

More details about the monitoring system can be found below: 

### Overview
Our healthcare chatbot system implements robust monitoring strategies to ensure reliable performance and early detection of potential issues in the production environment. The monitoring system focuses on two critical aspects: data drift detection and retrieval performance monitoring, complemented by an automated data pipeline for continuous improvement.

### Data Drift Detection Strategy

### Age Distribution Monitoring
Our primary data drift detection mechanism focuses on monitoring the age distribution of incoming patients. The system maintains a baseline distribution derived from our training dataset (PMC-Patients dataset) and continuously compares it with the current patient population using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This statistical approach helps identify significant shifts in patient demographics that could impact model performance.

When the KS test returns a p-value below 0.05, indicating a significant deviation from the baseline distribution, the system automatically triggers an alert. This early warning system enables proactive investigation of demographic shifts and their potential impact on model recommendations.

### Retrieval Performance Monitoring
The system's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) component is monitored through continuous analysis of retrieval scores. These scores indicate how well the system matches current patient cases with similar historical cases in our knowledge base. Low retrieval scores might indicate:
- Previously unseen medical conditions
- Edge cases not well-represented in our training data
- Potential gaps in our knowledge base

The monitoring system tracks both average and minimum retrieval scores, triggering alerts when scores fall below configured thresholds (currently set at 0.5). This helps maintain high-quality medical recommendations and identifies areas where the knowledge base might need enhancement.

### Automated Data Pipeline and Continuous Learning

Our system features an automated data pipeline implemented through AWS Lambda functions. When new medical data is uploaded to our S3 bucket, the pipeline automatically:
1. Triggers preprocessing of the new data
2. Generates embeddings for the processed information
3. Updates the Pinecone vector database with new embeddings

This automation ensures that our knowledge base remains current and continuously improves as new medical cases are added. The Lambda function's event-driven architecture provides a scalable and maintenance-free solution for data updates.

### Alert System and Response Protocol

![Low Retrieval Score](Images/EmailReceived.png)

![Age distribution drift](Images/EmailReceived1.png)

The monitoring system uses a sophisticated email-based alert mechanism that notifies relevant stakeholders when:
- Significant data drift is detected
- Retrieval scores fall below acceptable thresholds
- Data pipeline processing encounters issues

Alerts include detailed information about the detected issues, including:
- Statistical measures of detected drift
- Specific retrieval scores that triggered the alert
- Timestamp and context of the issue

### Continuous Improvement

The system implements several triggers for model retraining consideration:
1. Significant age distribution drift (p-value < 0.05)
2. Consistently low retrieval scores
3. Substantial new data accumulation (>20% of original training data)

These triggers help maintain optimal model performance and ensure the system evolves with changing patient populations and medical knowledge.


### Model Performance Monitoring

#### RAG Retrieval Quality
We implement continuous monitoring of retrieval scores to ensure relevant case matching:
- Threshold-based monitoring (minimum score: 0.5)
- Automated alerts for low-similarity retrievals
- Tracking of retrieval score distributions
- Integration with MLflow for metric logging

#### Automated Embedding Updates
Our system already maintains freshness through automated processes:
- Lambda function triggers for new data processing
- Automatic embedding generation and storage
- Seamless integration with Pinecone vector database
- Real-time updates to the retrieval system
- With the new embeddings, we will be able to generate more accurate doctor reports as the retrival score might improve.

### Implementation Benefits

## Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure

![Cloud Watch](Images/CloudWatch.png)

### Overview
Our application implements comprehensive logging through Amazon CloudWatch, providing centralized log management and monitoring capabilities across all components of our healthcare system. The logging infrastructure captures detailed operational data from our EKS cluster, Lambda functions, and SageMaker endpoints, enabling real-time monitoring and troubleshooting of our medical analysis pipeline.

### CloudWatch Implementation
CloudWatch serves as our primary logging solution, collecting logs from multiple sources within our architecture. As shown in the CloudWatch console, we maintain distinct log groups for different components, including `/aws/eks/PatientInsightEKSCluster/cluster` for Kubernetes operations, `/aws/lambda/airflow_trigger` for our automated data processing, and `/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B-patientInsight-endpoint` for model inference monitoring. This structured approach to log management ensures easy access to component-specific information while maintaining a comprehensive view of system operations.

### Log Management Strategy
Our logging strategy emphasizes automated collection and retention of operational data. CloudWatch agents deployed across our infrastructure automatically gather logs from application containers, system components, and AWS services. These logs are retained according to defined policies, with critical system logs kept for extended periods to support long-term analysis and compliance requirements. The logging system captures various operational aspects, including application performance metrics, error traces, and system health indicators.

### Monitoring and Alerting
The CloudWatch infrastructure not only collects logs but also enables proactive monitoring through custom metrics and alerts. We've configured automated notifications for critical events such as deployment failures, model performance degradation, or system errors. These alerts are integrated with our notification system, ensuring that the development team can respond quickly to any operational issues that arise in our medical analysis system.
